# _Questions..._

#### _It's a question board?  Yeah.  Yes it is, August the 19th, 2016_

## Description

_This is my question board built with Ember.  It's pretty cool, but I think I messed up a little bit logically orginizationally..._

## Setup/Installation Requirements

* _Do you have Ember installed on your machine???_
* _Clone this project._
* _'npm install'_
* _'bower install'_
* _'ember s'_
* _Go to 'http:localhost:4200' in yer browser of choice!_

_Check it out.  At time of writing, all the entries have to do with Led Zeppelin ripping people off.  If desired, check out https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_Led_Zeppelin_songs_written_or_inspired_by_others for some "inspiration"._

## Known Bugs

_Firebase is acting up quite a bit.  User may need to refresh to see actual current state of database._
_Only one user may be logged in at a time.  This is pretty bad design.  Also the login state is frequently determined by looping through all users in database on template pages.  This is a terrible choice, mixing logic duties, and is also a heavyhanded inefficient approach.  This should be rectified._
